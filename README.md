# Decision tree
Making your own decision tree

## Required installations:
  - Install pip3: `sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip`
  - Install python3: `sudo apt-get install python3`
  - Install pygame: `pip3 install pygame`

## Decision Tree:
A decision tree is a decision support tool that uses a tree-like graph or model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility. It is one way to display an algorithm that only contains conditional control statements. 

## Your Objectif:
We have coded a game of tic tac toe, on this game there is a player that is versing an A.I.

Your job is to create that A.I. using the MiniMax Algorithme.
More about this algorithme at this page : https://www.neverstopbuilding.com/blog/2013/12/13/tic-tac-toe-understanding-the-minimax-algorithm13
 
Making a decision tree is quite a complex thinking process but not so hard to code.
Good luck.
